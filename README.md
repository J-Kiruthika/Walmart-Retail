Customer   engagement   is   the   emotional   connection   between   a customer and a brand. Highly engaged customers buy more, promote more, and demonstrate more loyalty. ​

Technology has changed the way by which B2B or B2C companies work to engage customers.​

Research shows that contribution from a fully engaged customer represents 23% more revenue than average (Aberdeen Customer Engagement Report, 2014). ​

Customer retention is 14% higher among the companies applying big data and analytics to deal with the customer.​

Today’s retailers are focusing more on in-store automation to get an edge over the competitors and engaging the customer more effectively​

There is no doubt on the point that customer engagement leads to customer loyalty. ​

The objective is to create various innovative automation techniques that companies are using to better engage with their customers.​
